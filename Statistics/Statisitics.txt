Hyphothesis
---------------------
- Hypothesis is a statement, assumption or claim about the value of the parameter (mean, variance, median etc.).
- Two Types
    1. Null Hyphothesis:
        - The null hypothesis is the hypothesis to be tested for possible rejection under the assumption that it is true. 
        - The concept of the null is similar to innocent until proven guilty We assume innocence until we have enough evidence to prove that a suspect is guilty.
        -  It is denoted by H0.
    2. Alternate Hyphothesis
        - The alternative hypothesis complements the Null hypothesis. 
        -  It is denoted by H1.
 
 - Example:
    A soap company claims that itâ€™s product kills on an average 99% of the germs. To test the claim of this company we will formulate the null and alternate hypothesis.
    
    Null Hypothesis(H0): Average =99%
    Alternate Hypothesis(H1): Average is not equal to 99%.

    Note: The thumb rule is that statement containing equality is the null hypothesis.
